The artworks featured on this platform are created with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which operates under the direct input and supervision of human creators. This technology incorporates both free, open-source tools and portions of proprietary materials, utilized under fair use for the purpose of training and refining the AI models. All proprietary content is legally obtained and readily accessible.

Importantly, the AI models used here have been trained and retrained using resources that are personally owned and managed by the creators without the involvement of external companies' servers. No financial compensation or other forms of remuneration have been solicited, offered, or accepted in relation to the creation and distribution of these artworks.

If you find the concept or execution of AI-assisted art objectionable, you are encouraged to direct your attention elsewhere. Complaints or criticisms regarding the use of AI technologies or the legal bases for content creation will not alter the operational procedures or artistic choices of the owner.

This disclaimer itself was initially drafted with the assistance of an undisclosed AI chatbot, subsequently refined through multiple prompts to ensure a formal tone, as the owner lacks the ability to compose text in advanced English. This tool was used to facilitate clear communication and is disclosed in the spirit of transparency.

By engaging with this content, you acknowledge the use of AI in both the creation of the artworks and the drafting of this disclaimer. If you choose to engage with this content, do so with the understanding that the methods and materials used are firmly established and non-negotiable.
