The AI models employed in the creation of these pieces have been trained using publicly viewable materials, not unlike how traditional artists might study works displayed in museums to refine their craft. Ownership of these reference materials rests with their respective holders, yet their public exhibition allows for lawful observation and artistic inspiration, which is a globally recognized practice.

It is pertinent to highlight that many human artists acquire their skills through exposure to copyrighted materials, sometimes accessed via unauthorized means, such as anime viewed on piracy sites. This process of learning and creating derivative works, although informal, is widespread and analogous to the manner in which AI models assimilate diverse artistic influences.

Moreover, millions of students worldwide, predominantly in the developing world, are heavily or exclusively reliant on resources like Libgen and SciHub, or photocopies of copyrighted texts, for educational purposes. These practices are infringing on copyright laws, but are also driven by the necessity of access to knowledge. Similarly, the training of AI models on publicly accessible data is part of an overarching paradigm where learning and creation are prioritized over the strictures of content ownership.

This section is intended to contextualize the ethical landscape in which AI-driven art is produced, underscoring the parallels between traditional human learning and AI data processing. The use of such data by AI is not an anomaly but a part of a broader, complex dialogue about creativity, access to information, and the evolution of learning and artistic expression.
