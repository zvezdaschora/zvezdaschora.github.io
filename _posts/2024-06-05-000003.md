txt2img prompt: masterpiece, best quality, simple background, black background, solo, upper body, jensendxhr, anime, anime screencap, jensendxhrcoat, holding, phone, dimly lit

controlnet reference: ...that shot in the beginning of DXHR when he's talking to the phone

lora: custom jensen lora

number of generations: quite a bit. maybe around 50 for the initial image + 20 for the face detailer

editing: the lora generates the eyeshades by default, so i had to scrub that out

notes: 

- got lazy with the background
- ugh, im finally happy with this but i just realized that it got the jacket wrong
- first output with comfy UI, it's not bad but it does have a steeeeeep learning curve
