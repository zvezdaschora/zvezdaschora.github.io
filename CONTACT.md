# Contact

Due to the provocative nature of my work, I choose not to engage in public discussions or review comments about my creations. If you wish to reach out to me or have any inquiries, please feel free to contact me via email. To ensure your message catches my attention, please use a clear subject line and mention what you are commenting on and where you saw it within the first few sentences of your email.
